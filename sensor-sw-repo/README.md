# Sensor Software Repository

The Intel速 RFID Sensor Platform (Intel速 RSP) is a Linux based device whose operating system is built using the Yocto Project.  Updates to the packages in this device are released periodically in the form of an opkg repository.  When this repository is placed into the "deploy/rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/sensor-sw-repo" directory, each Intel速 RSP will automatically update its software from this repository when connected to the Gateway.  To comply with open source requirements, the source code for the various open source libraries used in creating the Hx000 software is also included here.  The files in this directory are...

    > Intel-RSP-EULA-Agreement.pdf
    > OpenSourceLibraries.url        (url to download the open source libraries) 
    > hx000-rrs-repo-yy.q.mm.dd.tgz  (yy.q.mm.dd is the opkg repository version)

The terms of use for this software are outlined in the Intel速 RSP EULA Agreement.  **_IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ AND AGREE TO THIS EULA BEFORE DOWNLOADING THIS SOFTWARE_**


## Getting Started

If you are using one of the build.sh scripts from either the native, docker or edge-x directories, the sensor-sw-repo will automatically be installed.  However, if you wish to install it manually or need to install an updated version, follow the steps outlined below.

``` 
# Copy the tar ball into the deploy directory
~/deploy$ ls
hx000-rrs-repo-yy.q.mm.dd.tgz  rsp-sw-toolkit-gw

# Extract the tar ball
~/deploy$ tar -xf hx000-rrs-repo-yy.q.mm.dd.tgz 
~/deploy$ ls
hx000-rrs-repo-yy.q.mm.dd  hx000-rrs-repo-yy.q.mm.dd.tgz  rsp-sw-toolkit-gw

# Copy the contents into the sensor-sw-repo directory
~/deploy$ cp -R ./hx000-rrs-repo-yy.q.mm.dd/* ./rsp-sw-toolkit-gw/sensor-sw-repo/
~/deploy$
```
